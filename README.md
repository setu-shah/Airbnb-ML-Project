# Machine Learning Applications for Airbnb Data

### Collaborators: Dhruv Shah, Jenn Hong, Sonya Dreyer

The problem of pricing and review prediction on Airbnb is a complex challenge that involves finding a balance between maximizing revenue for hosts, providing fair and transparent pricing for guests, and accurately predicting the quality of the accommodations. The goal of our project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of Airbnb listings based on a set of relevant features, and another model to predict the likely review outcomes for guests. These models help hosts set competitive prices for their listings and help guests to make more informed decisions by taking into account predicted review quality. We aim to provide data-driven insights into setting and evaluating Airbnb listing prices and enhancing the review prediction system. This can lead to a more efficient and satisfying marketplace for everyone, offering a holistic approach to the Airbnb experience.
